        <h2>Hi gals! Welcome to my blog. Once again it’s Ruby here. Just got back from my weekly Tarjay run and spent a
            good chunk on hubby’s credit card!!! 🤣 Anyway. My favorite thing I got is BY FAR these AMAZING hip shades.
            Just look at them! I will be linking them under this photo in case anyone wants to match! 🥰👯‍♀️</h2>

        <h2>Hi gals! Over the weekend I took the kids to the lake for a small getaway. As many of you guys know, my youngest daughter has recently started to learn how to swim and is starting to make wonderful progress. While we were on the boat, I was having a glass of wine (or two! 🍷😂) and she was on her own playing. After 30 minutes or so, my son called me over and I found her IN THE WATER. I was not worried one bit however! I knew she would prevail against the waves with her new swimming skills! However I was wrong. She wasn’t flapping her arms or legs at ALL, but floating farther and farther away from our boat! 😰 If it weren’t for the hot pink life jacket (also from tar jay! 🤣) my daughter could’ve been eaten by sharks. Thank you Target for sponsoring this post. 🙏🙏🙏</h2>

            <h2>Hi gals! MAJOR LIFE UPDATE. ‼️ WE GOT A DOG!!!!!!! 🐩 She is a limited edition pure bred Chanel White Pure Sphynx Poodle that we had specially bred all the way from France. She was very pricey. $10,000 but I think she’s worth it! 😍 What do you folks think we should name it? We have been leaning towards Wail Lynn. 

                Will be linking my dog breeder’s website down below if you guys are interested! 😘
